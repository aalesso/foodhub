# Foodhub with Bootstrap

In this project, we'll practice using Bootstrap.

## [Here is your target.](https://foodhub-with-bootstrap-target.herokuapp.com/landing.html)

## Setup

1. Follow [this guide](https://gist.github.com/raghubetina/22186869342fce3bec6b) to fork and clone this project.
1. Open the entire folder in Atom.
1. Open landing.html in Chrome.
1. Commit and Sync your work often as you go along, and once you are finished.

## Suggested Steps

 1. I've already downloaded and included Bootstrap in the project for you.
 2. I have also included an `additional_styles.css`, which contains my standard vertical spacing classes.
 1. I've already included all of the content without any formatting in `landing.html`.
 1. Use [Shoelace.io](http://shoelace.io/) to create a skeleton grid for your layout, and then copy-paste it into your page.
 2. Move the content into the appropriate cell in your skeleton.
 3. Utilize Bootstrap classes to make the page look like the target. Here are some things that might come in handy:
   - [Buttons](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons-options)
   - [Responsive images and shapes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images-responsive)
   - [Forms](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms)
   - [Media objects](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#media)
   - [Unstyled lists](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#unstyled)

You will have to write some of your own custom CSS for this project in `additional_styles.css`.

A hint for the full-width images: rather than including `<img>` elements in your HTML, instead use the images as the background for existing elements in CSS.

```
.who-delivers {
  background: url("images/main-hero.jpg") no-repeat center center;
  background-size: cover;
  color: white;
  height: 500px;
  padding-top: 150px;
}
```
